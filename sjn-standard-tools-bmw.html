Sid (https://twitter.com/sidisi767) here to discuss another Hunter deck creation with you. (I’m an 8x Golden Hunter and 12x Legend player and am pretty much obsessed with everything Hunter related (https://twitter.com/sidisi767).) When Blizzard printed Nine Lives they gave Hunter a unique tool to create persistent, sticky board states for Control decks to deal with. The biggest issue I encountered while attempting different variants of this deck was dealing with more aggressive decks. Long story ahead. Just finished a huge job and had to get this experience out lol. amp#x200B; So I've been detailing 5 years, since I was 18. I started in high school, learning from Ammo NYC, Youtube, AutoDetailing subreddit, and all sorts of places! I now have a business located at my home, along with my parents who have their own respective businesses. I do the detailing! I've grown and become the #1 Rated Detailer/Detail Shop in my Area over the years, with reviews above all others. Hello, in the next 2 months im going to upgrade to the CBW V2.5 Wheel. Im actually going for the V3 Inverted Pedals + the Shifter as well + a good rig for it, but those are for the near future (like 1-2months after the wheel purchase). But there is something that bothers me actually. My future setup will be the CBW V2.5 + BMW GT Rim. But the costs on them are different when it comes to shipping. Is there any reason i shouldnt get the bundle and go for the seperate purchase? The bundle gives. So I know a lot of people in this sub have been complaining about low quality posts and lack of real content outside the typical NTD posts as there's only so much discussion that can be had in regards to that, so I figured I'd try to share my experience and knowledge and help people find some very nice, very affordable usable tools. I spent near 4 years as an Emergency Vehicle Technician working on firetrucks, \~1 year as a plumber and now nearing three months as an Auto Technician working 
Written by Elias Dabbas (https://www.semrush.com/user/153946385/) Starting and managing SEM accounts can be —and usually is —a daunting task. In addition to hitting your business goals (revenue, conversions, clicks, etc.), you need an account structure that is not only systematic but easy to understand and maintain. In this article, I first briefly share my thoughts on account structure, then follow with detailed techniques that can help you build large accounts with numerous products. Hey everyone, amp#x200B; I made a post earlier about my time at an automatic (Drive up, employees clean car, send through, and dry/detail manually at the end) car wash/oil change place. I loved detailing cars when I was younger and that led to me getting into this job in highschool. I worked my way up fairly quickly to being the Assistant General Manager. I had full control of the day-to-day operations, hiring, training, customer service, detailing, oil changes, complaints \### Race information \ \ \ What?\ \ BMW Dallas Marathon \ \ \ When?\ \ December 9, 2018 \ \ \ How far?\ \ 26.2 miles \ \ \ Where?\ \ Dallas, TX \ \ \ Finish time:\ \ 3:29:09 amp#x200B; \### Goals Goal Description Completed? ------ ------------- ------------ A lt 3:30 \ Yes\ B lt 3:40 \ Yes\ amp#x200B; amp#x200B; \### Splits Kilometer Time ------ ------ 5k 24:09 10k 24:59 15k 24:22 20k 23:59. A few days ago someone posted that they really enjoyed the FH4, but weren’t much of a car enthusiast. The game doesn’t have much to delve into the history of the cars, so here’s some basic info about this week’s cars. Ealge Speedster https://m.imgur.com/115rfXS What is it? And why does it look like an old Jaguar?  Eagle, like Singer and Icon, create modernizations of classic cars. The Eagle Speedster is a moderinization of the Jaguar E-Type Roadster built from 1961-‘75. Widely reknow. I am a DIYer and I have a 2000 BMW 540i, it is a very fun car when everything is in working order, but since I hit 100k miles in 2016 it has had nothing but problems. This engine is built very unintuitively, changing the spark plugs is hell because of all of the unnecessary bolts and plastic covers and completely lack of space to fit a ratchet in, and god forbid you need to do any work on the AC system you need to jack the car up and come from underneath to get to the compressor.

So, this is an old article, but bear with me. This is the graph and calculation that Mazda used to demonstrate that an EV can be more polluting than a gasoline cars, depending on how the electricity is generated. https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--FbcGwQlU--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/wbfjlwviwktvxmslw35c.png Mazda claimed that a C-segment EV would use 21.2 kWh worth of electricity for travelling 100 km, and when using the dirtiest power generation method ### ACRL GT3 Series - Round 8 @ Nürburgring Nordschleife - Pre Race Thread # 2018 SEASON 2 THREAD (https://www.reddit.com/r/acrl/comments/822ooe/acrl_2018_season_2_announcement_sign_up/) #RACE INFO #### Date : 01/07/2018 #### Track: Nürburgring Nordschleife - download (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P4TDZqJ7_jnaaffdD6TARnMquDW57UZr/view?usp=sharing) #### Weather forecast: 11-16°C, sunny #EU SCHEDULE SESSION TIME LENGTH :---: :---: :---: PRACTICE 19:00 (https:/. ### ACRL GT3 Series - Round 7 @ Monza - Pre Race Thread # 2018 SEASON 2 THREAD (https://www.reddit.com/r/acrl/comments/822ooe/acrl_2018_season_2_announcement_sign_up/) #RACE INFO #### Date : 17/06/2018 #### Track: Monza - download (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DOzTA8OAIjOWtT7T1O_vm6A4Ei8EolVX) #### Weather forecast: Colder than August, but.
