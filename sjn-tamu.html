Texas AampM University is my first choice and dream school and I will be disappointed if I don‚Äôt get in. and with good reason. Academic admit is top 25% and 1360 (620M/660RW) SAT minimum. I am top 18% with a 1350(720M/630RW) and 3.49 unweighted. I applied to Mays Business school as my first choice and economics major as second choice. I‚Äôm literally so close to the academic admit and some of my friends already got in :/ pray for a brother üôèüèº I will be very anxious until my decision.

Ms. Jan Wiener. Undergraduate Studies provides programs and services that enrich student learning and promote student success. I know there are already too many posts on the internet about ut vs tamu lol. I want to go for engineering and online it says tamu and UT are neck and neck (they say tamu is slightly better but idk how reliable that is because UT is top 10 in engineering for everything). However, apparently tamu alumni are really close and if there‚Äôs like a job interview and a fellow Aggie sees your ring they‚Äôll immediately help you out. I think there might also be a handshake or the way you walk. Because

I feel like I've seen no one talk about it at all. I got into UT Austin, AampM College Station and Johns Hopkins. I'm trying to be optimistic about AampM cause that's probably where I will end up, but currently I'm really negative about it. Anybody have any pros and cons or can tell me how it is for someone who's not into the whole howdy/country thing. Martin J. Medhurst. How to apply as a freshman at Texas AM University.

The Office of Admissions has the primary responsibility of disseminating admissions information and materials to prospective undergraduate students, acting as the catalyst in identifying the students who will be admitted to the University and maintaining and storing the academic records Trying to finally move on from UT. I got accepted to the first year engineering programs at Purdue and TAMU, honors at TAMU as well. I'm looking to major in Electrical Engineering. I just got my estimated cost per year from Purdue, and it's the full k (out of state). Purdue obviously has a better engineering program than TAMU, but it's not worth an extra k/yr, right? I live in Texas. I wish I could be excited about going to TAMU, but I honestly feel like I'm cutting myself short I‚Äôm gonna submit my app this Tuesday and I was wondering when I could get my results since they‚Äôre doing rolling admissions.

I had auto admit to general admission through the top 10% rule but the Engineering school wasn‚Äôt scheduled to release decisions until late January. Roger Walton Jones. Howdy! Texas AM University is located in College Station, Texas. We are one of a select few universities with land-grant, sea-grant and space-grant designat. Almost all of the schools I have looked at have a sub-30% acceptance rate, so even though I have a 1580 on the SAT and a near-4.0 GPA I feel like they would all fall under reach or match schools. What schools with higher acceptance rates are you all looking at? EDIT - I should clarify that I live in Massachusetts, and I am mostly interested in English, history Hiroshi.

I just ended freshman year of college as a Biology major and for next semester I have to take Calculus 1 as I am looking to make the switch into Biomedical engineering. Now when it comes to anything related to math whether it be algebra, precalc, or even science classes like chemistry I have been a pretty bad test taker. I am not able to apply what I have learned successfully enough to garner a good grade (usually get a C on average). Calculus is foundational to most engineering disciplines. Lyle K. Sowls.
