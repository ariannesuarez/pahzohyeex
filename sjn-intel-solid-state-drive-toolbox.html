So my cat has sometimes fallen asleep on my laptop while its running and not locked. I always close my laptop while I'm gone for this reason. But I forgot to do so. When I got home she was chilling on the keyboard like it was her personal heating pad. The bad thing is that it was unresponsive. So I had to do a hard shut off. When it started, it immediately started system updating and installed the Windows Update. etc. etc. My dual solid state hardrive is now giving me a S.M.A.R.T error Hey all I recently got a refurbished Inspiron 7559, and it's great. But it only comes with an SHDD, so I wanted to add an m2 ssd to it. I bought an Intel pro 2500 from CEX (a second hand store in the UK) and put it in, but the windows formatting tool doesn't recognise the ssd at all. I also ran the intel ssd toolbox and it doesn't see it either. link to the ssd (https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/solid-state-drives/ssd-pro-2500-series-m2-specification.html), I got the 240GB So it looks like this is probably where I should've started. Already got some good help over on /r/Revit and /r/PcMasterRaceBuilds, but hoping for one more round of feedback and advice before making my imminent purchases. The two other prior threads, if anyone is curious: Revit: first attempt to build a Revit workstation for small-scale residential work, k budget {x-post from /r/PcMasterRaceBuilds} (https://www.reddit.com/r/Revit/comments/7mrge9/first_attempt_to_build_a_revit_workstatio. I called it the Blueberry because that kind of became the unintentional color theme. THE STORY: I did it. It took about three years of saving, six months of planning, and one month of slowly getting the parts together. But today, finally, I have completed my dream computer. In my family, money doesn’t come out of nowhere. My family isn’t particularly poor, but my parents believe that I should have to earn the money I want. I get a small allowance every month, but other

Treated myself to a little holiday SSD sale on the new Intel 600p. I've got it up and running on Windows 7 and it boots fine with my ASRock Fatal1ty Z97 board and Intel Core i5-4690k Devil's Canyon processor. Problem is, when I compare the results i'm getting from CrystalDiskMark to other results i've seen and what Intel rate's the performance as the reads are almost half of what they should be. I'm consistently getting reads of ~770 for Seq Q32T1 and Seq reads of ~700. http://imgur.com/a/ph. So I've been working on ML and NLP type problems for awhile now and I'd like to invest in some better hardware. I've built computers in the past, but they have mainly been for general purpose use. I've primarily been working with MatLab (but also use java, c++, python, and perl, and someday probably R), and was hoping for some input on what to put in this machine. Currently this is my build (except using 1600 RAM instead of 1333): PCPartPicker ###Troubleshooting Help: What is your parts list?

Now the problem is that the disk doesn't show up on either BIOS or Windows. What ive done so far is: Update bios Set boot to UEFI Tryed with Intel SSD Toolbox = doesnt show up.

I just got a Lenoo Ideapad S510p. I also bought a Intel 530 series SSD to put in it. The S510p works fine with the included hardware. The ssd worked fine in another computer I used to update its firmware and format it. When I put the SSD in the S510p and attempt to install Windows, nothing happens. The first time I booted with the SSD, it displayed a blank screen and did not show any life at all. I could not even enter the BIOS screen. It will only boot to the BIOS settings menus I have a LAN server in my home-office, it's an unusual machine because it's a completely solid-state 2U system with a giant copper heatsink covering the motherboard (an Intel S1200RP) attached to the outer-casing. Internally it's got a pretty decent Xeon E3 quad-core chip on it. The system was built by a specialist who makes industrial and naval computers who sold me some surplus stock. The computer has 3 SSDs in it: 1. Intel SSD DC S3500 (240GB) - Windows Server 2012 R2 and application. I'm pretty well versed with PC building and have built my own tower. It's just that the world of Mini PCs are all new to me and don't know which brands are good or not. Also there aren't many reviews on them or their components. I more need help with deciding which barebones rig to get. ###Build Help/Ready: Have you read the sidebar and rules ( (Please do) Yes What is your intended use for this build?

This workstation would be primarily for image processing (thresholding, ROI identification and subsetting), and image analysis and identification using machine vision to classify images (likely Support Vector Machines. I purchased a ssd for my computer. I copied my main drive so that I can boot from it. It is somehow detected by windows as I can use it as a second drive. The drive though has troubles with Intel toolbox and I can't boot from it. ''The Intel SSD Toolbox is having trouble communicating with the selected drive. The Intel SSD Toolbox is now rescanning the system to get an updated drive list.'' I use it on an AMD system with a k9n6pgm2-vs MSI motherboard. I wrote to intel and I can't figure. I went to BaPC, mostly because I don't really know where else to turn, and because my attempts at troubleshooting have come up with many different answers. A couple of years ago, I bought an Intel 510 SSD, 128 Gb.

Hello everyone, This is a build I've been wokring on for about 3 months now, and I really don't know how much more I can do to it. Any opinions would be really awesome! What I'll be using this pc for: AutoCAD rendering and MATLAB, other programming tools, some photoshop and Sony Vegas Pro 12, recording gameplay, and other silly engineering things. I also plan to do some gaming on this rig, and no, I have no interest at all in overclocking whatsoever. I mainly play RTS games such as Company. So lets get something out of the way first, my budget is around 00 (20.000DKR) and i have been saving for this for about 2½ year. I will be needing everything, as i have no screen, no mouse, no keyboard, i only use my laptop at this point. (ohh yeah and the 2 headset part isn't wrong, my GF needs a new pair as well) I have some parts picked out, what i need to know is, can i make a computer out of it? did i miss something? is some parts better than what i found to be fitting? One place. 
Thank you for checking this out. I have been reading this subreddit for a while now, but I'm brand new to computer building and have had problems researching how to build the best bang-for-my-buck Matlab machine. We will want to do some gaming as well (e.g. BioShock Infinite), but Matlab is the primary program we want to configure for. My SO is doing research that involves heavy modeling exclusively with Matlab. I understand that some of her larger computations will have to be done using </p>
