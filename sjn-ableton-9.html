I am running OS X Yosemite, does anyone know of detailed instructions to getting Ableton Suite. Hi there! I currently use Ableton 9 on Mac and I am about to get Ableton 10. I was wondering if after installing 10 I can safely uninstall the 9 without losing any projects/samples etc. Thanks. I installed the latest software version of the device and I can also see it in the list of asio drivers but if I choose it it will not connect. Hello everyone, I'm moving out to travel and make music, art, and to set up a business. I kept the box to my midi keyboard and it actually came with a copy of Ableton 9 Lite! Here is your free copy, you lucky bastard. 52D6-92CF-6540-19F2-F82D-81A6 Enjoy. 
I have ableton 9 and am just getting started in learning production. My question is, can I start learning by using ableton 9 for a while and be ok in terms of limitations or is ableton 10 just so much better. So I've been using my Volca Bass with Ableton for a while, just making midi sequences on ableton and sending them to the Volca, then recording myself doing manual knob changes, but now I'm trying to delve deeper into the midi funcionality of this thing, and I'm having trouble getting it to work quite right. I'm using ableton 9, the "envelope" section of the midi editor has a drop down list that lets me select every control change, I have the PDF of all the "secret" CC functions Tried lowering my buffer size to 256, still got a glitch part in the mix. Using internal soundcard of my Rane MP2015 hooked directly to computer with USB. 256 samples for buffer size, 44100 in/out sample rate. 16 gigs of RAM, Macbook pro running High Sierra 10.13.4. (I'm slow on updates so Rekordbox doesn't die on me) Should I lower the buffer again? I'm pretty new to this, so I don't know how much this affects sound quality of the recording, just the latency. In the DAW, when I mess with komplete kontrol settings such as filters or delay, it seems to have an automation of its own. It moves itself around and I can't seem to stop it even when I delete the channel and create a new one from scratch. It is very frustrating, has anyone had a similar problem. I keep getting crashes when opening up any project from the last week even though all my plug ins are up to date. I can not seem to find out what is going on because the projects i am attempting Please tell me I'm looking in the wrong place.but I swear it should be in my effects folder. 
As we all know, Ableton Live no longer works with 32-bit VSTs. This is kind of a shame, as there are a lot of 32-bit plugs that work well with processing vaporwave clips, mixes, etc. Now, Ableton does mention that you can use jBridge to "bridge" your 32-bit plugs for 64-bit use. The only problem is. JBRIDGE SUCKS!!! Massively so, in fact. I used it for a while.and it was far from "seamless". jBridged plugs wound up being major CPU resource hogs, they could be randomly buggy with no warning. This File C:\User\Name\Music\Music Production\WIP\Samples\Song name.als"could not be opened". It keeps saying that it can't find the temporary live files. I reboot the computer, I reauthorized my DAW. no solution. Does anyone know if there’s a way to tweak the settings for the audio to midi conversion option they have? (Convert harmony/melody/drums to new midi track). does anyone know if ableton live 9 is still available and how i can download. I have extremely frustrating problem. While setting up configuration on new laptop, Ableton crashes (goes off) anytime i'm choosing ASIO4ALL. Sometimes, when i connect one of 2 interfaces and then the second one, anything is fine beside the high CPU usage/latency. Is there any alternative for connecting both interfaces on Windows 10? I have never experienced similiar issues on my older laptop with Windows 7, with the same gear FOcusrite + iConnectivity. The use of second interface (iConnectivity. 
Hi, When I add Beatshuffler (max plugin) in Ableton 9, it makes my undo feature in Live useless. BeatShuffler appears to be add “actions” to the undo list even if I’m not modifying any settings/doing any automation with it. Is there Hi there, Pardon my ignorance, but I have no idea how to use Blue Cat's Patchwork with Autotune in Ableton. I can use it fine as a stand-alone, but that is not my objective as you may have guessed. Can anyone help or am I just missing something right there? Any help will be appreciated. Many thanks, Playto. So with the keyboard i got it came with a code for ableton 9 lite and i have been learning bits in it And im probably going to upgrade to 10 soon as i get a discount because i have 9 But how different are the 2 versions? Will i be able to get used to ableton 10 fairly quick if i know ableton 
Title says it all, basically I had a really messy breakup and I've moved like, 3 times since I purchased the product in 2015. Just hoping I won't </p>
